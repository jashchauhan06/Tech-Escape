All 6 Challenges Completely Redesigned:

 Challenge 1: IEEE Knowledge Quiz (Harder!)
- Before: Easy clicking buttons
- Now: 3 technical questions students must research:
  - IEEE 802.11 standard (WiFi)
  - TCP full form (Transmission Control Protocol) 
  - First computer virus year (1971)
- Answer: `IEEE{wireless_protocol_1971}`

 Challenge 2: Number System Conversion (No more convert button!)
- Before: Button did the work for them
- Now: Students must manually solve:
  - Binary `11010110` to decimal (214)
  - Hex `2F` to decimal (47)
  - Decimal `85` to binary (01010101)
- Answer: `CONVERT{214_47_01010101}`

 Challenge 3: Programming Logic (First-year friendly!)
- Before: Complex Python function
- Now: Simple programming concepts:
  - Operator precedence: `5 + 3 * 2` = 11
  - If-else syntax: missing keyword "else"
  - Loop iterations: `range(3,8)` runs 5 times
- Answer: `LOGIC{11_else_5}`

 Challenge 4: Electrical Engineering (No calculate button!)
- Before: Button calculated resistance
- Now: Students solve manually:
  - Parallel resistance: 8Ω and 12Ω = 4.8Ω
  - Ohm's Law: V=9V, R=3Ω → I=3A
  - Power: P=I²R, I=2A, R=5Ω → P=20W
- Answer: `OHMS{4.8_3_20}`

 Challenge 5: Cybersecurity (Replaced easy database!)
- Before: Simple database query
- Now: Real security challenges:
  - Caesar cipher decode: `WHFK HVFDSH` → "tech escape"
  - HTTPS port number: 443
  - SQL injection target: database
- Answer: `SECURE{tech_escape_443_database}`

 Challenge 6: Algorithm & Logic (Much better!)
- Before: Memory pattern game
- Now: Computer science problems:
  - Big O complexity: Linear search O(n)
  - Tree traversal: Inorder gives sorted order
  - Pattern: 2,6,12,20,30,42 (n(n+1))
  - Data structure: Stack uses LIFO
- Answer: `ALGO{n_inorder_42_stack}`
